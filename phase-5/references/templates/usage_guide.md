## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Numbers Look Wrong

- Last updated: See the footer of the dashboard
- If data looks stale (> 1 day old), contact support

- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Problem: Dashboard Won't Open

**Solution 1:** Open in a different browser  
**Solution 2:** Copy the file to a local folder and try again  
**Solution 3:** Try from a web server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
```

### Problem: Filters Not Working
