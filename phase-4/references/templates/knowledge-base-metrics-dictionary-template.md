# Knowledge Base Template — Metrics Dictionary

This template defines every metric the agent uses to answer questions, including definition, source, confirmed values, and calculation notes.

**Usage**: Fill in each metric category with customer-validated definitions from Phase 2. Emphasize metrics with multiple valid definitions or calculation nuances.

- NL phrasings: "[phrase 1]", "[phrase 2]", "[phrase 3]"

**[Metric 2]**
- Definition: [What it measures]
- Source: `[table].[column]`

**[Metric]**
- Definition: [Numerator] ÷ [Denominator]
- Confirmed: [Value] ([Count numerator] out of [Count denominator])

---

## [Category 3: Marketing/Engagement Metrics]

**[Metric with Multiple Valid Definitions]**

> ⚠️ **Always report BOTH definitions together** — never collapse to one number.
> Customer-confirmed rule: users asking "what's the [metric]?" must always see both values
> and which definition each uses, so they can choose which to cite.

- **Definition A (unique-recipient basis):** [Definition A text — e.g., "% of distinct recipients who opened at least one email"]
  - SQL: `[numerator_col] / [denominator_col]` FROM `[summary_table]`
  - Phase 3 confirmed value: [Value]% ([N numerator] / [N denominator])
  - Use when: reporting reach (how many people engaged)

- **Definition B (total-event basis):** [Definition B text — e.g., "% of total sends that resulted in an open, counting repeat opens"]
  - SQL: `SUM([event_col WHERE event='Opened']) / SUM([event_col WHERE event='Sent'])` FROM `[daily_table]`
  - Phase 3 confirmed value: [Value]% ([N events] / [N total])
  - Use when: reporting volume (how much engagement activity)

- **NL phrasings:** "[metric name]", "[metric name] rate", "how many [entities] [action]ed", "what's our [metric]"

> **Whole-range vs narrowed-range:** For the full date range, use exact counts from `[summary_table]`.
> For a narrowed range, only an approximation is available — say so explicitly.
